It might be surprising that as a psychotherapist, I'm writing about open source software.  But there are a few tools that I am very grateful for, as they contribute daily to making my life less stressful.  I'm a Mac user, so everything here is Mac-centric.

## Zotero

For reference managemnt, it has to be [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org).  The self-ascribed 'personal research assistant' makes it easy for me to keep track of, organise, and cite my ever-expanding collection of papers, articles, and PDFs.

### Keeping track of things

To be honest, I don't really have to soend much time doign this now as everything is in Zotero.  Everything syncs between my work and home Macs, and is also availabe through the Zotero web interface.  You can even choose to host full text versions of your files

## Zettlr

## Libre Office

## Gimp
